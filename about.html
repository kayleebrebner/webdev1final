      <p>Joey Miller was born and raised in Bristol, Indiana, where he cultivated an early love and talent for art. His kindergarten even called his parents and encouraged him to pursue art, after drawing a leaf</p>
        <p>“I don't know how that's possible to this day, there's no way that I was actually good at art, but they called my parents,” Miller said. “They said, ‘We think that he should pursue art because he seems to really be passionate about it.’”</p>
        <p>From that moment on, he assigned himself the title of artist. He started off as an oil painter and transitioned to murals and graffiti. But, a pivotal moment in his career was when he got a six-month museum internship as a 15-year-old at the University of Notre Dame.</p>
        <p>“I went to learn about curation and how to put on a show,” Miller said. “That’s really where my spark of art history and some of the things in my work ethic as an artist revolves around.”</p>
      <p>Starting off as an oil painter, Joey didn’t understand photography, “I thought it was dumb.” “I got home and my mom just handed me her camera and she's like, ‘Let's drive around.’ I went and I shot photos and I hated it. I was like, ‘This is stupid and I'm bad at it.’ But then I realized I loved that I was bad at it and that I got to start over and pick and choose the kind of artist I was rather than letting other artists around me choose for me.”</p>
      <p>Traveling with friends, Joey became the designated photographer of the group and started posting a photo a day on Twitter, where his photos quickly gained popularity in the photography community. “From then on, I hit the ground running, trying to share my art with people in the most meaningful way you can on social media. It’s not something I expected to do."</p>
